            While there are countless options, one
            tends
            to get lost when deciding on a color palette. if you want great suggestions or need to bring alive
            your
            thoughts and ideas, welcome to Luxe Events we have a rich portfolio to inspire you.
            Here are some key factors that determine your choice:


            </p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px">
                Choose colors that align with your personality.Are you trendy and love being contemporary? If so, go
                for
                vibrant colors such as purple, red and blue. On the other hand, if you like being minimalistic,
                choose
                light or neutral hues that truly represent your attitude and personality. Choose a wedding outfit
                that
                gets along with your style and decorative colors that sync with your lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px">
                Where do you plan to get married? If you have planned your wedding in a luxury hotel, choose elegant
                colors however if you have a small number of guests and the venue is a small garden, then opt for
                romantic and cool colors.
            </p></p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 18px">
                Don’t forget to choose a wedding theme color that represents the season you are getting married in.
                Blue
                and coral are great for summer while green is perfect for the spring season. Rust and copper make a
                wonderful combination for a fall wedding. These colors can be matched or contrasted with the color
                of
                your choice to bring in a compelling aesthetic.
            </p>
